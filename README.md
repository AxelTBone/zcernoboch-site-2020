# Zcernoboch (2020) â€” Archived

Static website from my early coursework. Publishing as a historical snapshot.

**Stack:** HTML, CSS, a bit of JS (Lightbox2).  
**Pages:** `index.html`, `mythology.html`, `slavicdeities.html`, `godofthemonth.html`

**What I'd improve today**

- Better color contrast and mobile spacing
- Licensed/attributed assets only
- Lighter shadows, cleaner typography

**Status:** Archived (read-only).

**Live demo:** <link once deployed>
